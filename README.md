### Exoplanet-Detection-Using-ML-DL
This repository contains the code and resources for an Exoplanet Detection System using Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The goal of this project is to detect exoplanets, which are planets that orbit stars outside our solar system, using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The system takes in astronomical data, such as light curves or spectra, and uses various machine learning algorithms to classify the data into different categories, such as exoplanet candidates or false positives.

ML models used are Decision Trees, Random Forest and XGB

A CNN model is used for binary classification
